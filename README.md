# Protein-structure-prediction
 This is a program that will compare the RSMD (root-mean-square-deviation) between a molecular geometry predicted by AlphaFold, and 
 molecular geometry known through experimentation. The algorithm for this program was derived from this paper : https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/Teaching/ECS129/Projects/Coutsias_2004.pdf

Instructions on how to use the program: 
1. Clone the repository. 
2. Ensure that you have both the two pdb files you want to comapre in the working directory. 
3. Use ```python/python3 dataframe.py``` to compile the program if the executable is not given to you.
